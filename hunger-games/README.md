## Hunger Games Simulator

### Intro
This all started when I saw people using an online hunger games simulator (brantsteele.net/hungergames).
My username was one of the tributes in that game, and it seemed like I had a good chance of winning with all of my "alliances," but it turned out they weren't actual alliances. One of my "allies" killed me immediately after sharing some food with me.

Don't worry, this story will get better.

I quickly opened up Vscode, took a minute to think about how to do what I was planning, closed Vscode, and opened my notebook.
After a week or two of working, I now have a complete simulator.

_Disclaimer: The events aren't complete. You'll either have to wait for me to finish the default ones or write your own._

### Advantages
AKA reasons why you would use this simulator instead of another.

#### Items
When tributes pick up items, they actually keep those items. This should be the standard, right? You can't kill someone with a knife unless you have a knife.

#### Real Alliances
Teammates don't kill each other. I mean, why would they?

#### Injuries
Tributes' injuries are stored with all the other data, so that they can only die of infection when they have an infection.

#### Color Coded Text
It's adjustable, but items are orange by default, players are cyan, killed players are red, and misc. other stuff is purple.
Also, this looks desaturated for some reason. The original is more colorful.

#### Completely Customizable
All of the events and players are stored inside json files, and they are extremely easy to edit.
