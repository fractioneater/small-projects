## **Python Journal**

### **Setup**

Check that you have python installed:

```
python3 --version
```
If it isn't, you will need to install it. Look up how to install python on your specific operating system / linux distribution.

Check if tkinter is installed:

```
python3 -m tkinter
```
If that doesn't work, you need to install tkinter. Follow the steps below.

Most package managers will have a package named python3-tk.
Check if it's available on yours, and install it if you haven't already.

I am using Debian, so `apt` is the package manager I have. If you don't know what package manager you have, find a tutorial for installing tkinter online.

My command looks like this, and yours will too if you are using something based off of Debian:
```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

After that, check if tkinter is installed by running the code above. If it works, you're ready.

Once tkinter is installed, you are ready.
